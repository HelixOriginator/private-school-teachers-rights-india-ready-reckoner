# Ready Reckoner for Private School Teachers (India)
## School Obligations · Teachers’ Rights · Service Rules · Termination & Due Process

A practical legal and compliance handbook for private school teachers in India.

This project brings together the laws, board byelaws, and service norms that schools are required or expected to follow — especially around appointments, contracts, pay, leave, discipline, and termination.

The goal is simple: make teachers aware of their rights and help schools follow fair, lawful processes.

Created by **Kallol Chakrabarti, Global Independent Researcher**.

## Why this exists

Many private school teachers face:

- Arbitrary or oral termination  
- Unclear contracts and probation rules  
- Delayed or unfair salary practices  
- Denial of statutory benefits (PF, gratuity, maternity, etc.)  
- Lack of awareness about due process  

Most problems happen because people don’t know what the rules actually say.

This ready reckoner translates legal requirements into plain, usable guidance.
