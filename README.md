# Ready Reckoner for Private School Teachers (India)
## School Obligations · Teachers’ Rights · Service Rules · Termination & Due Process

A practical, plain-language handbook that explains what private schools in India are required or expected to follow — and what teachers are legally entitled to during recruitment, service, discipline, and termination.

Created by **Kallol Chakrabarti, Global Independent Researcher**.

## Why this handbook exists

Across many private schools, teachers face:

- sudden or oral termination
- unclear contracts and probation rules
- unpaid or delayed salaries
- denial of statutory benefits (PF, gratuity, maternity, etc.)
- lack of due process in disciplinary actions
- limited awareness of legal remedies

Most issues arise not from complicated law, but from lack of clear information.

This ready reckoner brings together the key rules, laws, and safeguards in one place so teachers can understand their position and act with confidence.
